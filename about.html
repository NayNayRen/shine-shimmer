	<p class="poolTipLinks">Shine 'n Shimmer is a local family owned and operated pool cleaning service that was established in 2017. S 'n S is owned and
	operated by Gio Kozic, a long time resident of the Pinellas County area.</p>
	<p>As a pool owner himself, Gio understands the degree to which these recreational spots can play on our lives. To have the structure
	at home	to destress and decompress after the day, or enjoy the time outdoors with the family, is highly satisfying, and for some
	a neccesity.</p>
	<!-- <img class="missGio" src="images/missGio.jpg" alt="A photo of Gio and his wife Melissa."> -->
	<p class="poolTipLinks">Although we are a newly created pool company, we approach every new customer with a feeling of friendship and respect, as if
	we had known each other from childhood.</p>
	<p>S 'n S takes great pride in these new found friendships, as will be shown through our hard work, dedication, and commitment
	to you as a customer.</p>
	<p class="poolTipLinks">We encourage you to give us a call and set up a free estimate to begin your pool and recreation restoration.</p>
	<p>Thank you,<br><span id="signature">Shine 'n Shimmer</span></p>
