          <li>
            First and foremost, <span id="red">NEVER</span> leave a child
            unattended around any pool or water setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use pool barriers to secure your pool. A 4 foot high fence or
            barrier that utilizes a self latching gate as one example.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always keep children supervised. Maintain an arm's reach. Keep
            inexperienced or young swimmers in a life jacket or flotation device
            at all times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure that yours, or anyone else who will be watching kids, has
            adequate swimming skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure everyone in the house knows how to swim. If they do not,
            there are appropriately aged classes for water education and swim
            lessons through
